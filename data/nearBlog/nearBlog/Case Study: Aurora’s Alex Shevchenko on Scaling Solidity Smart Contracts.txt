NEAR is a home to a number of amazing apps and projects. These developers, founders, and entrepreneurs are using NEAR to effortlessly create and distribute innovative decentralized apps, while helping build a more open web — free from centralized platforms. In these Case Study videos, NEAR Foundation showcases some of these projects. 

In the latest NEAR Foundation Case Study video below, Alex Shevchenko, co-founder and CEO of Aurora Labs, talks about the developer studio’s work in making it easier for developers integrating Solidity smart contracts on NEAR. 

“Aurora is a solution that allows you to launch your Solidity smart contracts on NEAR,” says Shevchenko. “We’re also adding something new: a scalability feature for the NEAR Protocol — something that can make EVM future-safe and make a destination of Aurora plus NEAR a final one for businesses to come.”

“We are focusing on the user experience,” he adds. “We have a whole set of products that are helping blockchain businesses to make the user experience much more convenient.”
