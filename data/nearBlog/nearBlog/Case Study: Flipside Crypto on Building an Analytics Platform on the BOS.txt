CASE STUDIES
August 2, 2023
NEAR is a home to a number of amazing apps and projects. These developers, founders, and entrepreneurs are using NEAR to effortlessly create and distribute innovative decentralized apps, while helping build a more open web — free from centralized platforms. In these Case Study videos, NEAR Foundation showcases some of these projects. 

In the latest NEAR Foundation Case Study video, we hear Flipside Crypto’s Evan “Captain” Owens and GJ Flannery. Not only is Flipside a team building innovative on-chain data and analytics solutions on NEAR, but they were one of the first ecosystem projects to build on the Blockchain Operating System (BOS). 

In this case study video, GJ Flannery (Growth & Community) and Captain Owens (Strategic Partnerships) talk about the platform’s ecosystem of analytics and developers building widgets on the BOS with Flipside’s on-chain data. If you’re a founder or developer looking to hear directly from developers who’ve built on the BOS, then this Flipside Case Study video is not to be missed.
