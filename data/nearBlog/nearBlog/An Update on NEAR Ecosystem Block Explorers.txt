An Update on NEAR Ecosystem Block Explorers
NEAR FOUNDATION
October 10, 2023
TLDR: 

Explorer.near.org will be transitioned to the Explorer Selector by the end of November 2023. 
Public access to Explorer DB will be turned off on November 30, 2023. 
The Legacy NEAR Explorer will be turned off on January 31, 2024. NEARBlocks.io block explorer will continue to be actively maintained throughout this transition.
Pagodaâ€™s core goal is to provide the NEAR community with high-quality, reliable, and innovative tools to build and interact with the blockchain while fostering an ecosystem of innovation. The legacy NEAR block explorer, hosted at explorer.near.org, was originally built by Pagoda as the first and only block explorer on the NEAR blockchain. In the early days of NEAR, it was important to bootstrap the necessary indexers, databases, and a block explorer to keep track of events on the blockchain. As alternative block explorers have now met and surpassed the functionality and reliability of the original NEAR Explorer, Pagoda has decided to turn off public access to Explorer DB and transition the legacy NEAR Explorer to the Explorer Selector by the end of November. 

This leads to good news for those looking for a reliable and high-quality explorer experience. The Invoker Labs team behind NEARBlocks.io launched the Explorer Selector, enabling users and developers to pick their favorite community-built explorers. For projects that link out to explorer.near.org, those links will continue to work, but they will first display the Explorer Selector, where the user can select their preferred explorer and continue to the transaction, block, or account. 

For feedback on the Explorer Selector and/or to get your NEAR block explorer project listed, please visit the NEARBlocks Explorer Selector GitHub Repo. By the end of November 2023, explorer.near.org will be the new home for the Explorer Selector.
