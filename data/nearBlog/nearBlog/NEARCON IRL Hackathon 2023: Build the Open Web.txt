NEARCON IRL Hackathon 2023: Build the Open Web
NEAR FOUNDATION
September 28, 2023
If you attended NEARCON last year, you know the 48-hour IRL hackathon — “Building Beyond the Hype” was a great event, with all sorts of exciting prototypes that helped propel NEAR through the last year.

For NEARCON 2023, which will be held November 7-10th, we’re leveling up the hackathon. This year’s hackathon explores NEARCON 2023’s theme — “Step into the Open Web”. And that hacking together apps and experiences that explore how the NEAR Protocol and Blockchain Operating System are paving the way for a truly open web.

Let’s explore what’s new for the NEARCON 2023 Hackathon. 


Hacker HQ: a space just for the hackers
Not only do hackers get into NEARCON 2023 for free, but they also get their own space. NEARCON’s Hacker HQ will be a place for hackers to hang out, network, and build — whether that’s for the Hackathon or if you’re just interested in continuing to build your project on NEAR. Hacker HQ will be located at: 

Armazem 16
R. Pereira Henriques nº1, 1950-242
Lisboa, Portugal

Hack the days and nights away for a chance to build on the BOS and win $140k+.
