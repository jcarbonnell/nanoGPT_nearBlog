NEAR Foundation Launches New AMA Series
NEAR FOUNDATION
October 28, 2022
The NEAR Foundation realizes there has been an issue with communication to the NEAR ecosystem. We hear you. 

To that end, NEAR Foundation will host its first AMA on Twitter Spaces next Tuesday, November 1, which will be moderated by Community Team member Marcus Ribeiro. Bring your questions and concerns to Foundation CEO Marieke Flament, NEAR Co-founder Illia Polosukhin, and the rest of the Foundation leadership team. 

NEAR Foundation’s commitment to improving communication will also include a weekly blog and more regular AMAs designed to update the community on the Foundation’s activities. Bring your ideas to next week’s AMA as well as other future ones! 

Stay tuned for AMA details this coming Monday.
