Introducing NCON and How to Use It at NEARCON ‚Äò23
NEAR FOUNDATION
November 6, 2023
Hello NEARians,

By now many of you are in or are en route to the magical city of Lisbon for NEARCON23! The amount of alpha dropping this week will have you weak in your knees. It‚Äôs been our mission to bring you an event that puts Web3 experiences at the forefront of NEARCON. Even better when we partner with our Community to bring you a truly social experience elevating your journeys throughout NEARCON. This year NCON makes its big debut! 

What is NCON? 
The NEAR Foundation has partnered with Jutsu, Keypom, and Veriken to create an exciting experience for you: the NCON token ‚Äî an event experience built on B.O.S. NCON embodies the essence of the open web. An open web where we transact with each other on a peer to peer network. 

Interacting with sponsors, attending content sessions, paying for your lunch, will be part of the NCON experience. As you complete NCON Bounties (see the full list below), you‚Äôll be rewarded NCON which can be redeemed for swag, lunches, and other goodies during NEARCON. 

When you check in at registration you will automatically receive 100 NCON ‚Äî enough to buy lunch for 3 days and 1 piece of swag. Complete Bounties to earn more NCON and maximize your NEARCON experience. At the end of NEARCON, the top 3 NCON redeemers will receive a free trip to NEARCON24. Visit the helpdesk to verify your Bounty completions and get dropped NCON. 

Good luck and ‚Äúhappy bounting‚Äù!

*NCON exists for the purposes of NEARCON and NCON holds no real financial value beyond the event. Terms and conditions apply.
