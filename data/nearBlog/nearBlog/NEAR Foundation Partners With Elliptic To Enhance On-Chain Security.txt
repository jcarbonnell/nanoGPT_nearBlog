NEAR Foundation Partners With Elliptic To Enhance On-Chain Security
COMMUNITY
February 22, 2022
The NEAR Foundation is delighted to announce it is partnering with Elliptic to help enhance security and on chain forensics. 

The partnership means both the NEAR blockchain and its native asset $NEAR will have access to Elliptic’s class-leading blockchain analytics and financial crime monitoring services.

“NEAR’s mission is to help onboard billions of users into Web3,” says NEAR Foundation CEO Marieke Flament. 

“We can’t do that unless we can create a safe and secure environment for people to explore this new world. Partnering with projects like Elliptic helps us realise this goal faster.”

The agreement will provide users of NEAR with full visibility of the NEAR blockchain across Elliptic’s full suite of products and services. This will initially include screening of crypto wallets and transactions on the NEAR blockchain through Elliptic’s Lens and Navigator products, with plans to incorporate Virtual Asset Providers (VASPs verification) and crime investigation capabilities through Elliptics Discovery and Forensics. 

“Blockchain technologies are embedded in the financial mainstream and giving businesses the tools to use them transparently is critical to their safe and secure adoption,” said Elliptic CPO John Connolly. 

“Working with NEAR Foundation is another important step towards providing the deepest analytical and technical insight across a broad range of blockchain technologies to ensure businesses can identify trusted partners and work with cryptoassets with confidence.”

Elliptic provides compliance solutions and services for exchanges, protocols and Web3 businesses. Its analytics scan more than 500 cryptoassets and 20 billion+ data points to provide accurate, actionable insights that businesses rely on to mitigate risk and be compliant.
