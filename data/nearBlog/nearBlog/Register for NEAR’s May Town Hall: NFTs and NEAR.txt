Register for NEAR’s May Town Hall: NFTs and NEAR
COMMUNITY
May 16, 2022
Hey there, NEAR World! This month we’re exploring the world of NFTs. Join the community for NEAR’s May Town Hall on May 26, 2022, at 5:00pm GMT (1:00PM EDT/10:00am PDT) for a deep dive into NEAR’s ecosystem of NFT projects and platforms. 

NEAR Foundation CEO Marieke Flament will open the Town Hall with updates on the NEAR community and ecosystem, as well as the Foundation’s ongoing effort to onboard millions into Web3. 

The Town Hall will also include other exciting news, including details of a major NEAR Protocol upgrade. There will also be updates on strategic partnerships, ecosystem funding and education progress, upcoming crypto events, and a panel dedicated to the ever-evolving world of NFTs.

NEAR Protocol Validator Upgrade
One of the NEAR Foundation’s major missions is to help decentralize NEAR Protocol’s block validation. This is accomplished through regular protocol upgrades. 

In the May Town Hall, Pagoda will detail NEAR’s new staking pool contract, which will give validators additional features and functionality. Over the next few months, ecosystem players will work with validators and delegators to help migrate currently staked $NEAR from the old staking pool (poolv1.near) to the new staking pool (pool.near). 

Pagoda will share more details, including the pool migration timeline for validators and delegators. 

A Panel on NFTs in the NEAR ecosystem
NEAR Foundation CEO Marieke Flament will return to talk briefly about NEAR’s vibrant NFT marketplaces, projects, and creatives. There will also be a panel on NFTs, with surprise guests from across the NFT and NEAR ecosystems.
