NEAR at ETHCC: Step into the Open Web on the BOS
NEAR FOUNDATION
June 13, 2023
NEAR Foundation is excited to announce that NEAR will be returning to ETHCC 2023. The Foundation will be hosting a 2-day side event at the Paris tech conference on July 16-17.

NEAR experts will be on hand at ETHCC to share the latest updates for building apps on the open web  with the BOS  — an industry-first OS that makes it easy to use the tools you already know to build apps that engage users, while fostering an open web untethered from centralized platforms. 

Also, learn how your project can get funding and other support from NEAR Horizon, the new Web3 startup platform built on the BOS. 

NEAR at ETHCC — What to expect
NEAR is hosting a two-day ETHCC side event on July 16-17th, that will feature Technical Workshops (BOS) hosted by Pagoda, a Horizon Pitch Competition, small ETH research group workshops (invite only), and other speaker sessions, keynotes, and panels. You can’t forget about our exclusive networking and happy hours!

Learn from the best in the NEAR ecosystem about what makes the BOS so revolutionary. Ask your questions. Learn in-person. Make connections!
