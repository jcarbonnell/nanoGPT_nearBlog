Community Update â€“ Beyond Launch
COMMUNITY
October 27, 2020
Hello citizens of NEARverse! This is NiMA coming to you from a NEARby planet in the Milky Chain â€¦

We have collectively voted to remove the training wheels from the NEAR blockchain and are now in the post-launch phase. The fate of NEAR is now in the hands of the NEAR community. Validators, token holders, users, and builders all play a significant role in what happens next â€¦ 

â€¦ which is why we would like to invite every single one of you to join us in the next NEAR Community Town Hall on Nov 2nd on Hopin! 


NEAR Core team members will share updates about our NEAR-term roadmap, wallet and staking, projects building on NEAR, and tons of cool stuff from our community of Guilds and Hackathon participants. You will also be able to interact directly with other community members in breakout sessions and find out how YOU can contribute to the NEAR ecosystem ðŸš€

The breakout sessions will be the following (happening in parallel):

Deep Tech â€“ lead and moderated by Illia and AlexS (NEAR co-founders) 
Wallet and Staking â€“ moderated by Kendall Cole with participation from validators
Guilds and Hack the Rainbow â€“ moderated by Dani and NiMA (dev community team)
Donâ€™t forget to sign up for NEAR Town Hall here on Hopin ðŸ™Œ

Balancer BUIDLing on NEAR 
Automated Market Makers (aka AMMs) are one of the core building blocks of any open finance platform. We are partnering with Balancer to provide builders on NEAR with the best tools to power their DeFi projects.
Balancer is more than just a DEX. In addition to basic DEX functionalities, Balancer can also be used for creating and managing self-balancing smart index funds, fair token launches, and much more. You can read more about our collaboration and the two bounties powering Balancer on NEAR here on our blog! 

Hack the Rainbow Winners!
Hack the Rainbow was NEARâ€™s first MOOH (Massive Open Online Hackathon). The event challenged community members to use the Rainbow Bridge to utilize Ethereum assets on NEARâ€”a fast, scalable, and low-cost environment. More than 400 participants and 80 projects from 18 countries around the world were submitted! Meet the winners.
